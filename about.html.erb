# About This Site

YJIT-Metrics is maintained by the [YJIT](https://yjit.org) team at [Shopify](https://shopify.com).

We're trying to build a JIT for [CRuby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) that's faster than the current MJIT, especially for complex code like Ruby on Rails.

You can find [our benchmarks here](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench).
